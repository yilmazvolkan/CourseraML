## Support Vector Machines


Informally, the C parameter is a positive value that controls the penalty for misclassified training examples. A large C parameter tells the SVM to try to classify all the examples correctly. C plays a role
similar to 1/lambda, where lambda is the regularization parameter that we were using previously for logistic regression.


## Kernel


You can think of the Gaussian kernel as a similarity function that measures the â€œdistance" between a pair of examples, (x(i); x(j)). The Gaussian kernel is also parameterized by a bandwidth parameter, , which determines how fast the similarity metric decreases (to 0) as the examples are further apart. We can compute the kernel by;
