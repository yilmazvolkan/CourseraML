##Â Neural Network Cost Function


The formula is for the regularized cost function:

And our network should look like this:

We can compute the regularized cost function directly:

J is our cost function and we add regularization part with computed reg. 


## Neural Network Backpropagation


To min cost function just like gradient descent. The process mathematically is:

We already did this part in the previous implementation.

We already calculate the yk and a3 and we can use them here.

Thirdly,  we compute the delta 2 according to given backpropagation formula. sigmoidGradient function basically calculates:

According to this part, we compute Delta1 and Delta2 and we are ready to compte D. D matrix is used as an accumulator to add up our values as we go along and eventually compute our partial derivative of cost function. Regularization version of D can be computed as follows:
